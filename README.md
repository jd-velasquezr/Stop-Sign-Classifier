# Stop-Sign-Classifier
 This project was written using TensorFlow to build a model for detecting STOP signs in traffic images. We implemented transfer learning using the ResNet50 model, training it with 500 images of STOP signs and streets without this sign. We applied normalization techniques, image preprocessing, and filtering to optimize the model's performance. We achieved an accuracy of 85% with an MCC of 72%. This project addresses crucial challenges for autonomous vehicles, improving the detection of traffic signs on the road and contributing to road safety.

 Achievements and Features:
